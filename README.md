# Homework0
Homework 0 of ECE 231: Intermediate Programming. Assigned 1/15/2020. Due 1/22/2020, 11:59 pm.
The goal for this homework is the get acquainted with the software that you are going to be using for the rest of the semester. By the end of this assignment you will achieve two things:

    Get a Linux system working
    Create a Github account & have Git working on your linux system
  
  
## Getting a Linux system
There are two ways of doing this:
### Linux
If you have a Linux machine (Ubuntu, Pop!OS, Redhat, Linux Mint, etc), please take a look at setting up your Github account and getting Git working on your machine.
### All operating systems (except Linux)
You can download a virtual machine that can host a different operating system. I like to use VM Virtual Box (because its free) and the link to download the software is here:

Once you have downloaded Virtual Box feel free to download your favorite Linux OS, for first timers I recommend Ubuntu:

### MacOS
You either can download Virtual Box from the section above or download Xcode to run C/C++ software.

### Windows
You either can dowload Virtual Box from the section above or activate and use the Linux system for Windows 10
